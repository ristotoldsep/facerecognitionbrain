Full Stack Application for detecting faces in submitted images! Used Clarifai API for face recognition.
With user authentication and counting the number of images submitted!

Front-end created with HTML, CSS, JS - (ACTUALLY REACT.js)
Used "tachyons" library for styling!

Back-end server following RESTful API created with Node.js, Express and several dependencies (bcrypt for pw hashing)

Database created with postgreSQL, which contains user, login and entries information. (knex.js for server-db connection)

Everything is deployed in Heroku on separate servers.
